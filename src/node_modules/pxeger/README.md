# Pxereg

Pxereg (regexp inversed) is a little package allowing to generate all possible string from a regexp source string. The pxeger grammar does not follow exactly the regexp one, so some features may be missing, but it should cover most of use cases.

## Usage

### In node

```
# npm install pxeger
```

```js
var Pxeger = require( 'pxeger' );

console.log( Pxeger.reverse( 'fo{2,5}' ) );
```

### In browser

Download **pxeger.min.js** somewhere then :

```
console.log( Pxeger.reverse( 'fo{2,5}' ) );
```

## Unsupported feature

These features cannot work with Pxereg :

- `*` modifier, because it is not bounded, and would generate infinite strings
- `+` modifier, for the same reason
- `{N,}` modifier, for the same reason

These features would be nice but are not implemented and may never be :

- Backward references
- `[^N]`, I don't really see the point in this kind of library ?
- `[[:blank:]]`, it wouldn't be hard to do but I don't have the time right now

Pull requests are welcome. If you wish to tweak the grammar, feel free to use my [PEG.js online editor](http://peg.arcanis.fr/), which has been used to write this package.
